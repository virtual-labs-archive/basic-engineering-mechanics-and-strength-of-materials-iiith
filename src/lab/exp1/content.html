            A tensile test, also known as tension test, is probably the most fundamental type of mechanical test you can perform on material. Tensile tests are simple, relatively inexpensive, and fully standardised. 

	By pulling on something, you will very quickly determine how the material will react to forces being applied in tension. As the material is being pulled, you will find its strength along with how much it will elongate.
Tensile testing is one of the more basic tests to determine stress – strain relationships. A simple uniaxial test consists of slowly pulling a sample of material in tension until it breaks.

            Tensile testing is one of the more basic tests to determine stress – strain relationships. A simple uniaxial test consists of slowly pulling a sample of material in tension until it breaks. Test specimens for tensile testing are generally either circular or rectangular with larger ends to facilitate gripping the sample.

          The tensile test is a test performed to know the ductility of the particular material. In practical, the test is carried out on universal testing machine (also called the UTM). When tension is applied to a particular member, the stresses are developed in the member at the centre. At a particular point of time during the testing, the member breaks.

         <strong> Young’s modulus:</strong> Young’s modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain. It is denoted by ‘E’. 1. Young's Modulus (Modulus of Elasticity) In the region on the stress-strain curve where the stress changes linearly with the strain, the Young’s modulus (Modulus of elasticity, E) is defined as the ratio of stress and strain. Value of the Young’s modulus is a constant for a given material.

1. The load pointer is set at zero by adjusting the initial the initial setting mode. <br>
2. The dial gauge is fixed for measuring elongation of small amounts.<br>
3. Measure the diameter of the test piece with the help of a vernier calliper at least at three pieces and determine the mean value. Also mark the gauge length.<br>
4.  Now the specimen is gripped between the upper and middle cross head jaws of the machine.<br>
5. Start the machine and the specimen is gradually loaded. Note down the load and its corresponding dial gauge reading. The observations are taken until the  specimen breaks<br>
6. Plot the graph between stress vs. strain.</p>
